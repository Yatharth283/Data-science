CBSE Class 10 Science Revision Notes Chapter 1 Chemical Reactions and Equations

Chemical Reactions
A chemical reaction occurs when one or more reactants are changed into one or more products. The constituent atoms of the reactants are rearranged in a chemical reaction, resulting in the formation of various substances as products.

Physical and Chemical Changes
Chemical change – one or more new substances with new physical and chemical properties are formed.
Chemical Reactions and Equations-1
Here, when copper sulphate reacts with iron, two new substances, i.e., ferrous sulphate and copper, are formed.
Chemical-Reactions-and-Equations-2
Physical change – change in colour or state occurs, but no new substance is formed.
Example: Water changes to steam on boiling, but no new substance is formed (Even though steam and water look different when they are made to react with a piece of Na, they react the same way and give the exact same products). This involves only a change in state (liquid to vapour).

Chemical Reactions and Equations MCQ Practice Solutions
Observations that Help Determine a Chemical Reaction
A chemical reaction can be determined with the help of any of the following observations.
a) Evolution of a gas
b) Change in temperature
c) Formation of a precipitate
d) Change in colour
e) Change of state

Chemical Reaction
Chemical reactions are chemical changes in which reactants transform into products by making or breaking bonds (or both) between different atoms.

A chemical reaction is a process that causes one set of chemical components to change into another. Chemical reactions are defined as changes in the locations of electrons in the formation and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change in the nuclei, and are described using a chemical equation. At a given temperature and chemical concentration, chemical reactions occur at a predictable rate. Reaction speeds often increase as the temperature rises because more thermal energy is available to attain the activation energy required to break bonds between atoms.

Types of Chemical Reactions
Taking into consideration different factors, chemical reactions are grouped into multiple categories.
A few examples are:
● Combination
● Decomposition
● Single Displacement
● Double displacement
● Redox
● Endothermic
● Exothermic
● Precipitation
● Neutralisation

Chemical Reactions and Equations I
Word Equation
A  word equation is a chemical reaction expressed in words rather than chemical formulas. It helps identify the reactants and products in a chemical reaction.

A chemical reaction is described using a word equation, which is a shorthand manner of expressing it. The names of the reactants are shown on the left side of a word equation. If there is more than one reactant, the names of the reactants are separated by a plus sign (+). Products are shown on the right side of a word equation. If there is more than one product, the names of the products are separated by a plus sign (+).
For example,
Sodium + Chlorine → Sodium chloride
The above equation means: “Sodium reacts with chlorine to form sodium chloride.”

Symbols of Elements and Their Valencies
A symbol is a chemical code for an element. Each element has a one or two-letter atomic symbol, which is, in most cases, the abbreviated form of its name.
Valency is the combining capacity of an element. It can be considered as the number of electrons lost, gained or shared by an atom when it combines with another atom to form a molecule.

Writing Chemical Equations
Representation of a chemical reaction in terms of symbols and chemical formulae of the reactants and products is known as a chemical equation.

 Chemical Reactions and Equations-3
• For solids, the symbol is “(s)”.
• For liquids, it is “(l)”.
• For gases, it is “(g)”.
• For aqueous solutions, it is “(aq)”.
• For gas produced in the reaction, it is represented by “(↑)”.
• For precipitate formed in the reaction, it is represented by “(↓)”.

To know more about Chemical Equations, visit here.

Balancing of a Chemical Reaction
Law of Conservation of Mass
According to the Law of Conservation of Mass, no atoms can be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, so the number of atoms for each element on the reactants side has to balance the number of atoms that are present on the products side.
In other words, the total mass of the products formed in a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of the reactants participating in a chemical reaction.

Balanced chemical equation
The chemical equation in which the number of atoms of each element on the reactants side is equal to that of the products side is called a balanced chemical equation.

To know more about Balanced Chemical Equations, visit here.

Steps for Balancing Chemical Equations
The changes that occur during a chemical reaction are represented by a chemical equation.

Reactants → Products

The equilibrium of all chemical equations must be maintained. This means that on both sides of the arrow, the number of each sort of atom must be the same.

Chemical equations are balanced using coefficients. A coefficient is a numerical value that is added to the front of a chemical symbol or formula. It indicates the number of atoms or molecules of the material involved in the process.

Place coefficients in front of symbols or formulas as needed to balance a chemical equation so that the same number of each type of atom appears in both reactants and products.

For example,

Zn + HCl → ZnCl2 + H2

The balanced equation is

Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl2 + H2

Hit and trial method: While balancing the equation, change the coefficients (the numbers in front of the compound or molecule) so that the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the chemical equation.

Short-Cut Technique for Balancing a Chemical Equation
Example:

aCaCO3 + bH3PO4 → cCa3(PO4)2 + dH2CO3

Set up a series of simultaneous equations, one for each element.

Ca: a=3c

C: a=d

O: 3a+4b=8c+3d

H: 3b=2d

P: b=2c

Let’s set c=1

Then a=3 and

d = a = 3

b = 2c = 2

So a=3; b=2; c=1; d=3

The balanced equation is

3CaCO3 + 2H3PO4 → Ca3 (PO4)2 + 3H2CO3

When quicklime or calcium oxide (CaO) reacts with water, slaked lime [Ca(OH)2] is formed. During this reaction, a large amount of heat is released. So, this reaction is an exothermic Reaction.

CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2

Decomposition Reaction
A single reactant decomposes on the application of heat or light, or electricity to give two or more products.
Types of decomposition reactions:
a. Decomposition reactions which require heat-thermolytic decomposition or thermolysis.

Redox Reaction
A redox reaction occurs when the oxidation states of the substrate change. The loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state of a chemical or its atoms is referred to as oxidation. The gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state of a chemical or its atoms is referred to as reduction.

Oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously.
Oxidation: Substance loses electrons or gains oxygen or loses hydrogen.
Reduction: Substance gains electrons or loses oxygen or gains hydrogen.
Oxidising agent – a substance that oxidises another substance and self-gets reduced.
Reducing agent – a substance that reduces another substance and self-gets oxidised.

Introduction to Acids, Bases and Salts
A substance that tastes sour in water, turns blue litmus red, and neutralises the bases is known as an acid. If a substance’s aqueous solution tastes bitter, turns red litmus blue, or neutralises acids, it’s called a base. Salt is a neutral material that has no effect on litmus in an aqueous solution.

Classification of Matter
On the basis of
a) Composition –  elements, compounds and mixtures
b) State – solids, liquids and gases
c) Solubility – suspensions, colloids and solutions

Types of mixtures – homogeneous and heterogeneous
Types of compounds – covalent and ionic

To know more about the Classification of Matter, visit here.

What Is an Acid and a Base?
Ionisable and Non-Ionisable Compounds
An ionisable compound, when dissolved in water or in its molten state, dissociates into ions almost entirely. Examples: NaCl, HCl, KOH, etc.
A non-ionisable compound does not dissociate into ions when dissolved in water or in its molten state. Examples: glucose, acetone, etc.

Acids and Bases
An acid is any hydrogen-containing substance that is capable of donating a proton (hydrogen ion) to another substance. A base is a molecule or ion able to accept a hydrogen ion from an acid. Acidic substances are usually identified by their sour taste.

Bronsted Lowry Theory
A Bronsted acid is an H+ (aq) ion donor.
A Bronsted base is an H+ (aq) ion acceptor.

Example

In the reaction: HCl (aq) + NH3 (aq) → NH+4(aq) + Cl− (aq)
HCl – Bronsted acid and Cl− : its conjugate acid
NH3 – Bronsted base and NH+4 : its conjugate acid

To know more about the Bronsted Lowry Theory, visit here.

Physical Test
Given are two possible physical tests to identify an acid or a base.

a. Taste
An acid tastes sour, whereas a base tastes bitter.
The method of taste is not advised, as an acid or a base could be contaminated or corrosive.

Example: The flavours of curd, lemon juice, orange juice, and vinegar are all sour. Because they contain acids, these compounds have a sour flavour. Baking soda has a sour flavour. It’s an example of a foundation.

b. Effect on Indicators by Acids and Bases
An indicator is a chemical substance which shows a change in its physical properties, mainly colour or odour, when brought in contact with an acid or a base.
Below mentioned are commonly used indicators and the different colours they exhibit:

a) Litmus
In a neutral solution – purple
In an acidic solution – red
In a basic solution – blue

Litmus is also available as strips of paper in two variants – red litmus and blue litmus.
An acid turns a moist blue litmus paper to red.
A base turns a moist red litmus paper to blue.

b) Methyl orange
In a neutral solution – orange
In an acidic solution – red
In a basic solution – yellow

c) Phenolphthalein
In a neutral solution – colourless
In an acidic solution – remains colourless
In a basic solution – pink

Acid-Base Reactions
A neutralisation reaction occurs when an acid reacts with a base. Salt and water are the end products of this reaction. An acid–base neutralisation reaction is formulated as a double-replacement reaction in this standard approach.

Reactions of Acids and Bases
a) Reaction of acids and bases with metals
Acids, in general, react with metals to produce salt and hydrogen gas. Bases, in general, do not react with metals and do not produce hydrogen gas.

Acid + active metal →  salt + hydrogen + heat

2HCl + Mg → MgCl2 + H2 (↑)

Hydrochloric acid + Magnesium → Magnesium chloride + Hydrogen

Base + metal → salt + hydrogen + heat

2NaOH + Zn → Na2ZnO2 + H2 (↑)

Sodium hydroxide + Zinc → Sodium zincate + Hydrogen

A more reactive metal displaces the less reactive metal from its base.

2Na + Mg (OH) 2 → 2NaOH + Mg

Sodium + Magnesium hydroxide → Sodium hydroxide + Magnesium

b) Reaction of acids with metal carbonates and bicarbonates
Acids produce carbon dioxide, as well as metal salts and water, when they react with metal carbonates or metal bicarbonates. Sodium chloride, carbon dioxide, and water are formed when sodium carbonate interacts with hydrochloric acid. Allowing carbon dioxide gas to travel through lime water turns it milky.

Acid + metal carbonate or bicarbonate →  salt + water + carbon dioxide.

2HCl + CaCO3 → CaCl2 + H2O + CO2
H2SO4 + Mg (HCO3)2 → MgSO4 + 2H2O + 2CO2

Effervescence indicates the liberation of CO2 gas.

c) Reaction of Acid with Base
1. Reaction of metal oxides and hydroxides with acids
Metal oxides or metal hydroxides are basic in nature.
Acid + base → salt + water + heat

H2SO4 + MgO → MgSO4 + H2O
2HCl + Mg (OH) 2 → MgCl2 + 2H2O

2. Reaction of non-metal oxides with bases

Non-metal oxides are acidic in nature
Base + Nonmetal oxide →  salt + water + heat

2NaOH + CO2→ Na2CO3 + H2O

3. Reaction of acids and base

A very common acid is hydrochloric acid. The reaction between strong acid, says hydrochloric acid and strong base say sodium hydroxide, forms salt and water. The complete chemical equation is shown below.

HCl (strong acid) + NaOH (strong base) → NaCl (salt) + H2O (water)

Water
Acids and Bases in Water
When added to water, acids and bases dissociate into their respective ions and help in conducting electricity.

Difference between a Base and an Alkali
Base:

Bases undergo a neutralisation reaction with acids.
They are comprised of metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates and metal bicarbonates.
Most of them are insoluble in water.
Alkali:

An alkali is an aqueous solution of a base, (mainly metallic hydroxides).
It dissolves in water and dissociates to give OH− ion.
All alkalis are bases, but not all bases are alkalis.
To know more Difference between a base and an alkali, visit here.

Hydronium Ion
Hydronium ion is formed when a hydrogen ion accepts a lone pair of electrons from the oxygen atom of a water molecule, forming a coordinate covalent bond.

CBSE Class 10 Science Notes Chapter 2 - 1

Dilution
Dilution is the process of reducing the concentration of a solution by adding more solvent (usually water) to it.
It is a highly exothermic process.
To dilute acid, the acid must be added to water and not the other way round.

Strength of Acids and Bases
Strong acid or base: When all molecules of a given amount of an acid or a base dissociate completely in water to furnish their respective ions, H+(aq) for acid and OH−(aq) for base).
Weak acid or base: When only a few of the molecules of a given amount of an acid or a base dissociate in water to furnish their respective ions, H+(aq) for acid and OH−(aq) for base).CBSE Class 10 Science Notes Chapter 2 - 2
Dilute acid: contains less number of H+(aq) ions per unit volume.
Concentrated acid: contains more number of H+(aq) ions per unit volume.

CBSE Class 10 Science Notes Chapter 2 - 3

Universal Indicator
A universal indicator has a pH range from 0 to 14 that indicates the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.
A neutral solution has pH=7

pH
pH=−log10[H+]
In pure water, [H+]=[OH−]=10−7 mol/L. Hence, the pH of pure water is 7.
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.
If pH < 7 → acidic solution
If pH > 7→ basic solution

pH scale

Importance of pH in Everyday Life
1. pH sensitivity of plants and animals
Plants and animals are sensitive to pH. Crucial life processes such as digestion of food, functions of enzymes and hormones happen at a certain pH value.

2. pH of a soil
The pH of a soil optimal for the growth of plants or crops is 6.5 to 7.0.

3. pH in the digestive system
The process of digestion happens at a specific pH in our stomach which is 1.5 to 4.
The pH of the interaction of enzymes, while food is being digested, is influenced by HCl in our stomach.

4. pH in tooth decay
Tooth decay happens when the teeth are exposed to an acidic environment of pH 5.5 and below.

5. pH of self-defence by animals and plants
Acidic substances are used by animals and plants as a self-defence mechanism. For example, bee and plants like nettle secrete a highly acidic substance for self-defence. These secreted acidic substances have a specific pH.

Manufacture of Acids and Bases
Manufacture of acids and bases
a) Nonmetal oxide + water → acid

SO2(g) + H2O(l) → H2SO3(aq)
SO3(g) + H2O(l) → H2SO4(aq)
4NO2(g) + 2H2O(l) + O2(g) → 4HNO3(aq)

Non-metal oxides are thus referred to as acid anhydrides.

b) Hydrogen + halogen → acid

H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)
HCl(g) + H2O(l) → HCl(aq)

c) Metallic salt + conc. sulphuric acid → salt + more volatile acid
2NaCl(aq) + H2SO4(aq) → Na2SO4(aq) + 2HCl(aq)
2KNO3(aq) + H2SO4(aq) → K2SO4(aq) + 2HNO3(aq)

d) Metal + oxygen → metallic oxide (base)
4Na(s) + O2(g) → 2Na2O(s)
2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)

e) Metal + water → base or alkali + hydrogen
Zn(s) + H2O(steam) → ZnO(s)+ H2(g)

f) Few metallic oxides + water → alkali
Na2O(s) + H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)

g) Ammonia + water → ammonium hydroxide
NH3(g) + H2O(l) → NH4OH(aq)

Salts
Salt is a combination of an anion of an acid and a cation of a base.

Examples – KCl, NaNO3 , CaSO4, etc.

Salts are usually prepared by the neutralisation reaction of an acid and a base.

Common Salt
Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is referred to as common salt because it’s used all over the world for cooking.

Family of Salts
Salts having the same cation or anion belong to the same family. For example, NaCl, KCl, LiCl.

pH of Salts
A salt of a strong acid and a strong base will be neutral in nature. pH = 7 (approx.).
A salt of a weak acid and a strong base will be basic in nature. pH > 7.
A salt of a strong acid and a weak base will be acidic in nature. pH < 7.
The pH of a salt of a weak acid and a weak base is determined by conducting a pH test.

Chemicals from Common Salt
Sodium chloride is a common salt. NaCl is its molecular formula. The fundamental element in our meals is sodium chloride. It is used in our food as a flavour enhancer as well as a preservative. From common salt, we may make the following four compounds.

Sodium hydroxide or lye or caustic soda
Baking soda or sodium hydrogen carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate
Washing soda or sodium carbonate decahydrate
Bleaching powder or calcium hypochlorite
Preparation of Sodium Hydroxide
The strong base sodium hydroxide is a common and useful one. Preparing a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water requires extra caution because the exothermic reaction releases a lot of heat. It’s possible that the solution will spatter or boil. Here’s how to manufacture a sodium hydroxide solution safely, as well as recipes for a variety of NaOH strengths.

Chemical formula – NaOH
Also known as – caustic soda

600px Chloralkali membrane.svg

Preparation (Chlor-alkali process):
Electrolysis of brine (solution of common salt, NaCl) is carried out.
At anode: Cl2 is released
At cathode: H2 is released
Sodium hydroxide remains in the solution.

Bleaching Powder
Bleaching powder is soluble in water and is used as a bleaching agent in textile industries. It is also used as an oxidizing agent and a disinfectant in many industries. It should also be noted that bleaching powder is synthesized by the reacting chlorine gas on dry slaked lime i.e. Ca(OH)2.

Chemical formula – Ca(OCl)Cl or CaOCl2
Preparation – Ca(OH)2(aq)+Cl2(g)→CaOCl2(aq)+H2O(l)

On interaction with water – bleaching powder releases chlorine which is responsible for bleaching action.

Uses of Bleaching Powder

It is used for bleaching dirty clothes in the laundry, as a bleaching agent for cotton and linen in the textile industry.
It is a strong oxidizing agent, hence used as an oxidizer in many industries.
It is used as a disinfectant which is used for disinfecting water to make potable water.
Baking Soda
Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda, is a chemical compound with the formula NaHCO3 and the IUPAC designation sodium hydrogen carbonate. A sodium cation (Na+) and a bicarbonate anion (HCO3) combine to form this salt. Sodium bicarbonate is a white, crystalline substance that is commonly found as a fine powder. It tastes slightly salty and alkaline, like washing soda (sodium carbonate).

Chemical name – Sodium hydrogen carbonate
Chemical formula – NaHCO3

Preparation (Solvay process):
a. Limestone is heated: CaCO3→CaO+CO2
b. CO2 is passed through a concentrated solution of sodium chloride and ammonia:
NaCl(aq)+NH3(g)+CO2(g)+H2O(l)→NaHCO3(aq)+NH4Cl(aq)

Uses:

Reduces the acidity in the stomach
Acts as an antacid which is used to treat stomach upset and indigestion
Used in the process of washing as a water softener
Washing Soda
Chemical name – Sodium hydrogen carbonate
Chemical formula – NaHCO3
Preparation (Solvay process) – 
a. Limestone is heated: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
b. CO2 is passed through a concentrated solution of sodium chloride and ammonia:
NaCl(aq) + NH3(g) + CO2(g) + H2O(l) → NaHCO3(aq) + NH4Cl(aq)

Uses
1. In the glass, soap and paper industries
2. Softening of water
3. Domestic cleaner

Crystals of Salts
Certain salts form crystals by combining with a definite proportion of water. The water that combines with the salt is called water of crystallisation.

The process by which a solid form, in which the atoms or molecules are strongly arranged into a structure known as a crystal, is known as crystallisation. Precipitation from a solution, freezing, and, more rarely, direct deposition from a gas are some of the ways crystals form.

Example:

Table salt (sodium chloride or halite crystals), sugar (sucrose), and snowflakes are examples of common materials that form crystals. Many gemstones, such as quartz and diamond, are crystals.

Plaster of Paris
Plaster of Paris is a widely used chemical compound that is extensively used in sculpting materials and gauze bandages. Plaster of Paris is a white powdery chemical compound that is hydrated calcium sulphate that is usually obtained by calcining gypsum. While we have seen many applications of this material in our everyday lives, if we try to understand its chemistry, we will find that it is a white powdery chemical compound that is hydrated calcium sulphate that is usually obtained by calcining gypsum. To put it another way, Plaster of Paris is often manufactured of heated gypsum at a high temperature.

Gypsum plaster is another name for the plaster of Paris. Plaster of Paris is expressed as CaSO4. ½ H2O in the chemical formula.

Gypsum, CaSO4.2H2O (s) on heating at 100°C (373K) gives CaSO4. ½ H2O and 3/2 H2O
CaSO4. ½ H2O is plaster of Paris.
CaSO4. ½ H2O means two formula units of CaSO4 share one molecule of water.
Uses – cast for healing fractures.

Physical Properties
Any measurable property whose value describes a condition of a physical system is referred to as a physical property. A system’s physical properties can be utilised to characterise its transitions between brief states. 
Observables are a term used to describe physical qualities. 
Physical Properties of Metals
● Hard and have a high tensile strength – Carbon is the only non-metal with very high tensile strength.
● Solid at room temperature – One non-metal, bromine, is a liquid at room temperature. The other non-metals are solids at room temperature, including carbon and sulfur.
● Sonorous – Metals produce a typical ringing sound when hit by something.
● Good conductors of heat and electricity – Graphite is a good conductor of heat and electricity.

Chemical Properties
Chemical Properties of Metals
● Alkali metals (Li, Na, K, etc.) react vigorously with water and oxygen or air.
● Mg reacts with hot water.
● Al, Fe and Zn react with steam.
● Cu, Ag, Pt, and Au do not react with water or dilute acids.

Reaction of Metals with Oxygen (Burnt in Air)
A metal oxide is formed when metals are burned in the air and react with oxygen in the air. Metal oxides are a type of basic material found in nature. They change the colour of red litmus to blue. To avoid reactions with oxygen, moisture, and carbon dioxide in the air, sodium and potassium metals are kept in kerosene oil.

Metal + Oxygen→ Metal oxide (basic)
● Na and K are kept immersed in kerosene oil as they react vigorously with air and catch fire.
4K(s)+O2(g)→2K2O(s) (vigorous reaction)
● Mg, Al, Zn, and Pb react slowly with air and form a protective layer that prevents corrosion.
2Mg(s)+O2(g)→2MgO(s) (Mg burns with white dazzling light)
4Al(s)+3O2(g)→2Al2O3(s)
● Silver, platinum and gold don’t burn or react with air.

Basic Oxides of Metals
Metal oxides are crystalline solids that contain a metal cation and an oxide anion. They typically react with water to form bases or with acids to form salts. MO + H2O → M(OH)2 (where M = group 2 metal). Thus, these compounds are often called basic oxides.

Some metallic oxides get dissolved in water and form alkalis. Their aqueous solution turns red litmus blue.

Na2O(s)+H2O(l)→2NaOH(aq)
K2O(s)+H2O(l)→2KOH(aq)

Amphoteric Oxides of Metals
Amphoteric oxides are metal oxides which react with both acids as well as bases to form salt and water.
For example – Al2O3, ZnO, PbO, SnO
Al2O3(s)+6HCl(aq)→2AlCl3(aq)+3H2O(l)
Al2O3(s)+2NaOH(aq)→2NaAlO2(aq)+H2O(l)
ZnO(s)+2HCl(aq)→ZnCl2(aq)+H2O(l)
ZnO(s)+2NaOH(aq)→Na2ZnO2(aq)+H2O(l)

3Fe+4H2O(steam)→Fe3O4+4H2

Reaction of Metals with Acid
When a metal is immersed in acid, it becomes smaller and smaller as the chemical process consumes it. Gas bubbles can also be detected at the same moment. Hydrogen gas bubbles are formed as a result of the reaction. Because hydrogen is combustible, this can be demonstrated with a burning splint.
Metal+diluteacid→Salt+Hydrogengas
2Na(s)+2HCl(dilute)→2NaCl(aq)+H2(g)
2K(s)+H2SO4(dilute)→K2SO4(aq)+H2(g)

Only Mg and Mn, react with very dilute nitric acid to liberate hydrogen gas.
Mg(s)+2HNO3(dilute)→Mg(NO3)2(aq)+H2(g)
Mn(s)+2HNO3(dilute)→Mn(NO3)2(aq)+H2(g)

Displacement Reaction
A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound or solution.

How Do Metals React with the Solution of Other Metal Salts
A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its salt solution in a displacement reaction. Metal displacement reaction is a common name for this reaction. The reactivity of certain regularly used metals has been ordered in decreasing order. This is referred to as the reactivity or activity series.

Metal A+Salt of metal B → Salt of metal A + Metal B

Fe(s)+CuSO4(aq)→FeSO4(aq)+Cu(s)
Cu(s)+2AgNO3(aq)→Cu(NO3)(aq)+2Ag(s)

It’s a component of thermite welding. Aluminium displaces iron from its oxide in this process.
It is used in the production of steel. In which iron is displaced from its oxide by carbon.
It is mostly utilised in metal extraction.
Reaction of Metals with Bases
The base has a bitter taste and a slippery texture. A base dissolved in water is called an alkali. When chemically reacting with acids, such compounds produce salts. Bases are known to turn blue on red litmus paper.

Base+metal → salt+hydrogen
2NaOH(aq)+Zn(s) → Na2ZnO2(aq)+H2(g)
2NaOH(aq)+2Al(s)+2H2O(l) → 2NaAlO2(aq)+2H2(g)

Occurrence of Metals
Most elements, especially metals, occur in nature in a combined state with other elements. All these compounds of metals are known as minerals. But out of them, only a few are viable sources of that metal. Such sources are called ores.
Au, Pt – exists in the native or free state.

Extraction of Metals
The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called Mining. The metal ores are found in the earth’s crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground! The ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges. Ores consist of the desired metal compound and the impurities and earthly substances called Gangue.

CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 3 - 1

Metals of high reactivity – Na, K, Mg, Al.
Metals of medium reactivity – Fe, Zn, Pb, Sn.
Metals of low reactivity – Cu, Ag, Hg

To know more about the Extraction of Metals, visit here.

Enrichment of Ores
It means the removal of impurities or gangue from ore through various physical and chemical processes. The technique used for a particular ore depends on the difference in the properties of the ore and the gangue.

In chemistry, a gangue is an undesirable substance or impurity that surrounds the mineral in an ore deposit, such as sand, rock, or any other material. When it comes to mining, this mineral is very frequent.

Extracting Metals Low in Reactivity Series
By self-reduction- when the sulphide ores of less electropositive metals like Hg, Pb, Cu etc., are heated in air, a part of the ore gets converted to oxide, which then reacts with the remaining sulphide ore to give the crude metal and sulphur dioxide. In this process, no external reducing agent is used.

1. 2HgS(Cinnabar)+3O2(g)+heat→2HgO(crude metal)+2SO2(g)
2HgO(s)+heat→2Hg(l)+O2(g)

2. Cu2S(Copper pyrite)+3O2(g)+heat→2Cu2O(s)+2SO2(g)
2Cu2O(s)+Cu2S(s)+heat→6Cu(crude metal)+SO2(g)

3. 2PbS(Galena)+3O2(g)+heat→2PbO(s)+2SO2(g)
PbS(s)+2PbO(s)→2Pb(crudemetal)+SO2(g)

Extracting Metals in the Middle of Reactivity Series
Calcination is a process in which ore is heated in the absence of air, or air might be supplied in limited quantity. Roasting involves heating ore lower than its melting point in the presence of air or oxygen. Calcination involves the thermal decomposition of carbonate ores.

Smelting – it involves heating the roasted or calcined ore (metal oxide) to a high temperature with a suitable reducing agent. The crude metal is obtained in its molten state.
Fe2O3+3C(coke)→2Fe+3CO2

Aluminothermic reaction – also known as the Goldschmidt reaction, is a highly exothermic reaction in which metal oxides, usually of Fe and Cr, are heated to a high temperature with aluminium.
Fe2O3+2Al→Al2O3+2Fe+heat
Cr2O3+2Al→Al2O3+2Cr+heat

Extraction of Metals Towards the Top of the Reactivity Series
Electrolytic reduction:

1. Down’s process: Molten NaCl is electrolysed in a special apparatus.

At the cathode (reduction):
Na+(molten)+e−→Na(s)
Metal is deposited.

At the anode (oxidation):
2Cl−(molten)→Cl2(g)+2e–
Chlorine gas is liberated.

2. Hall’s process: A mixture of molten alumina and a fluoride solvent, usually cryolite (Na3AlF6), is electrolysed.

At the cathode (reduction):
2Al3++6e–→ 2Al(s)
Metal is deposited.

At the anode (oxidation):
6O2– → 3O2(g)+12e–
Oxygen gas is liberated.

The metals at the top of the reactivity series are highly reactive. They cannot be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon, because these metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. Hence, for the extraction of such metals electrolytic reduction method is used.

Refining of Metals
Refining of metals – removing impurities or gangue from crude metal. It is the last step in metallurgy and is based on the difference between the properties of metal and gangue.

Electrolytic Refining
Metals like copper, zinc, nickel, silver, tin, gold etc., are refined electrolytically.
Anode: impure or crude metal
Cathode: a thin strip of pure metal
Electrolyte: aqueous solution of metal salt

From anode (oxidation): metal ions are released into the solution
At cathode (reduction): the equivalent amount of metal from the solution is deposited
Impurities deposit at the bottom of the anode.

How Do Metals and Non-Metals React?
Metals lose valence electron(s) and form cations.
Non-metals gain those electrons in their valence shell and form anions.
The cation and the anion are attracted to each other by strong electrostatic force, thus forming an ionic bond.
For example: In calcium chloride, the ionic bond is formed by opposite-charged calcium and chloride ions.
The calcium atom loses 2 electrons and attains the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas (Ar). By doing so, it gains a net charge of +2.

CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 3 - 2

The two Chlorine atoms take one electron each, thus gaining a charge of -1 (each) and attain the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas (Ar).

CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 3 - 3

Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds are neutral compounds that are made up of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions. Binary ionic compounds (ionic compounds containing only two types of elements) are named by first writing the name of the cation, then the name of the anion.

The electrostatic attractions between the opposite-charged ions hold the compound together.
Example: MgCl2, CaO, MgO, NaCl etc.

Properties of Ionic Compound
Ionic compounds

Are usually crystalline solids (made of ions).
Have high melting and boiling points.
Conduct electricity when in aqueous solution and when melted.
Are mostly soluble in water and polar solvents.
To know more about Ionic Compounds, visit here.

Physical Nature
Ionic solids usually exist in regular, well-defined crystal structures.

Electric Conduction of Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten or aqueous state when ions become free and act as charge carriers.
In solid form, ions are strongly held by electrostatic forces of attraction and are not free to move; hence do not conduct electricity.

CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 3 - 5

CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 3 - 4
For example, ionic compounds such as NaCl do not conduct electricity when solid, but when dissolved in water or in a molten state, they will conduct electricity.

CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 3 - 6

Melting and Boiling Points of Ionic Compounds
In ionic compounds, the strong electrostatic forces between ions require a high amount of energy to break. Thus, the melting point and boiling point of an ionic compound are usually very high.

Solubility of Ionic Compounds
CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 3 - 7

Most ionic compounds are soluble in water due to the separation of ions by water. This occurs due to the polar nature of water.
For example, NaCl is a 3-D salt crystal composed of Na+ and Cl− ions bound together through electrostatic forces of attraction. When a crystal of NaCl comes into contact with water, the partially positive-charged ends of water molecules interact with the Cl− ions, while the negatively charged end of the water molecules interacts with the Na+ ions. This ion-dipole interaction between ions and water molecules assists in the breaking of the strong electrostatic forces of attraction within the crystal and, ultimately, in the solubility of the crystal.

Corrosion
Alloys
Alloys are homogeneous mixtures of a metal with other metals or nonmetals. Alloy formation enhances the desirable properties of the material, such as hardness, tensile strength and resistance to corrosion.

Examples of a few alloys:
Brass: copper and zinc
Bronze: copper and tin
Solder: lead and tin
Amalgam: mercury and other metal

Corrosion
Gradual deterioration of a material, usually a metal, by the action of moisture, air or chemicals in the surrounding environment.
Rusting:
4Fe(s)+3O2(from air)+xH2O(moisture)→2Fe2O3. xH2O(rust)

Corrosion of copper:
Cu(s)+H2O(moisture)+CO2(from air)→CuCO3.Cu(OH)2(green)

3. Galvanization: This is a process of coating molten zinc on iron articles. Zinc forms a protective layer and prevents corrosion.

4. Electroplating: It is a method of coating one metal with another by the use of an electric current. This method not only lends protection but also enhances the metallic appearance.
Examples: silver plating, and nickel plating.

5. Sacrificial protection: Magnesium is more reactive than iron. When it is coated on articles made of iron or steel, it acts as the cathode undergoes a reaction (sacrifice) instead of iron and protects the articles</p>

Covalent Bonding
Difficulty of Carbon to Form a Stable Ion
To achieve the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas, He, if the carbon atom loses four of its valence electrons, a huge amount of energy is involved. C4+ ion hence formed, will be highly unstable due to the presence of six protons and two electrons.

If the carbon atom gains four electrons to achieve the nearest electronic configuration of the noble gas, Ne, C4− ion will be formed. But again, a huge amount of energy is required. Moreover, in C4+ ions it is difficult for 6 protons to hold 10 electrons. Hence, to satisfy its tetravalency, carbon shares all four of its valence electrons and forms covalent bonds.

Ionic Bond
Ionic bonding involves the transfer of valence electron/s, primarily between a metal and a nonmetal. The electrostatic attractions between the oppositely charged ions hold the compound together.
Ionic compounds:

Single, Double and Triple Bonds and Their Strengths
A single bond is formed between two atoms when two electrons are shared between them, i.e., one electron from each participating atom.
It is depicted by a single line between the two atoms.

A double bond is formed between two atoms when four electrons are shared between them, i.e., one pair of electrons from each participating atom. It is depicted by double lines between the two atoms.

A triple bond is formed between two atoms when six electrons are shared between them, i.e., two pairs of electrons from each participating atom. It is depicted by triple lines between the two atoms.

Bond strength:
– The bond strength of a bond is determined by the amount of energy required to break a bond.
– The order of bond strengths when it comes to multiple bonds is: Triple bond>double bond>single bond
– This is to signify that the energy required to break three bonds is higher than that for two bonds or a single bond.

Bond length:
– Bond length is determined by the distance between nuclei of the two atoms in a bond.
– The order of bond length for multiple bonds is: Triple bond<double bond<single bond
The distance between the nuclei of two atoms is least when they are triple bonded.

Why Carbon Can Form so Many Compounds
Catenation occurs most readily with carbon due to its small size, electronic configuration and unique strength of carbon-carbon bonds. Tetravalency, catenation, and the tendency to form multiple bonds with other atoms account for the formation of innumerable carbon compounds.

For more information on Various Carbon Compounds, watch the below video


Catenation
Catenation is the self-linking property of an element by which an atom forms covalent bonds with the other atoms of the same element to form straight or branched chains and rings of different sizes. It is shown by carbon, sulphur and silicon.

S8
In its native state, sulphur shows catenation of up to 8 atoms in the form of S8 molecule. It has a puckered ring structure.

Carbon-and-Its-Compounds-21

Versatile Nature of Carbon
Tetravalency and Catenation The fact that carbon can form single, double, and triple bonds demonstrate its versatility. It can also form chains, branching chains, and rings when joined to other carbon atoms.

Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and a few additional elements make up organic molecules. Organic compounds, on the other hand, are significantly more numerous than inorganic compounds that do not form bonds.

Carbon is a chemical element with the atomic number 6 and the symbol C. It’s a versatile element that can be found in a wide variety of chemical combinations. Carbon’s versatility is best appreciated through properties like tetravalency and catenation.

Tetravalency: Carbon has a valency of four, so it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent element.
Catenation: The property of a carbon element due to which its atom can join one another to form long carbon chains is called catenation.

          <p>   Many small glands present in the inner layer of the stomach and intestine take part in the digestion of food.
These glands are present in the epithelial lining of the stomach and intestine.
The glands present in different regions of the stomach are called gastric glands.
They are responsible for the secretion of mucus, hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsinogen.
The glands present in the epithelial lining of the small intestine and large intestine are called intestinal glands.
Glands of the small intestine are responsible for the secretion of intestinal juice, also called succus entericus.
Intestinal juice contains hormones, digestive enzymes, alkaline mucus, and substances to neutralize hydrochloric acid coming from the stomach.
Intestinal juice completes the digestion started by the pancreatic juice.
Glands of the large intestine are associated with the absorption of water and electrolytes.
Villi and Micro Villi
Complete digestion and absorption of food take place in the small intestine.
Pancreatic juice coming from the pancreas, bile from the liver and intestinal juice secreted by the intestinal glands complete the digestion of food material.
All the digested nutrients are absorbed by the long finger-like projections present in the ileum of the small intestine.
These small finger-like projections of the inner wall of the intestine are called villi (singular: villus).
Each villus has its cell membrane of the lumen side again folded into microscopic processes called microvilli.
Villi increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls making available a greater surface area for absorption.
Digested nutrients pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion.
Villi also help in the chemical digestion of food by secreting digestive enzymes.

Liver
Liver Diagram

The liver is the largest and major digestive gland of humans
The liver, in humans, is located in the upper right-hand portion of the abdomen.
This organ is dark reddish-brown in colour due to an extensive blood supply.
Some of the important functions of the liver are as follows:
It secretes bile which helps in digestion.
It filters the blood coming from the digestive tract before passing it to the rest of the body.
It detoxifies various metabolites and antidotes.
The liver makes proteins important for blood clotting and other functions.
It stores and releases glucose as needed.
It processes haemoglobin from the dead and worn-out RBCs, for the iron content (the liver stores iron).
The conversion of harmful ammonia to urea takes place in the liver.
To know more about the Liver, visit here.

Digestive Juices
Pancreatic juice, bile and intestinal juice (succus entericus) are collectively called digestive juices.
A common duct from digestive glands pours the secretions into the duodenum.
Chyme enters the small intestine, where complete digestion takes place due to the action of various enzymes.
In the duodenum, the acidity of chyme is turned to alkalinity by the action of bile coming from the liver. This is necessary for pancreatic enzyme action.
Bile also emulsifies the fats into smaller globules.
Pancreatic and intestinal amylases break down carbohydrates into glucose.
Trypsin and chymotrypsin are the proteases responsible for the breakdown of proteins finally into amino acids.
Lipase is the enzyme which acts on the emulsified fats and breaks them down into glycerol and fatty acids.

The large intestine is not involved in the digestion of food or absorption of nutrients.
The major function of the large intestine is to absorb water from the remaining indigestible food matter and make the stool solid.
The large intestine also helps in the absorption of vitamins made by bacteria that normally live in the large intestine.
The innermost layer of the large intestine also acts as a barrier and protects from microbial infections and invasions.
Rectum stores the undigested food temporarily until defecation.
Respiration
Introduction to Respiration
Respiration broadly means the exchange of gases.
Animals and plants have different means of exchange of gases.
At a cellular level, respiration means the burning of food to generate the energy needed for other life processes.
Cellular respiration may take place in the presence or absence of oxygen.

Respiration in Humans
The human respiratory system is more complex and involves breathing, the exchange of gases and cellular respiration.
A well-defined respiratory system helps with breathing and the exchange of gases.
Breathing involves the inhalation of oxygen and the exhalation of carbon dioxide.
The gaseous exchange takes place in the lungs, and oxygen is supplied to all cells of the body.
Cellular respiration takes place in each and every cell.
Respiratory System
The human respiratory system involves the nose, nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx, trachea/windpipe, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli.
Bronchioles and alveoli are enclosed in a pair of lungs.
The rib cage, muscles associated with the rib cage and diaphragm all help in the inhalation and exhalation of gases.
The exchange of gases takes place between an alveolar surface and surrounding blood vessels.
Alveoli provide a large surface area for the exchange of gases.
For more information on Respiration, watch the video below

To know more about Respiratory System, visit here.

Physiology of Respiration
Breathing in humans is facilitated by the action of internal intercostal and external intercostal muscles attached to the ribs and the diaphragm.
When the dome-shaped diaphragm contracts and becomes flattened and the rib cage is expanded due to the action of intercostal muscles, the volume of the lungs increases, pressure there drops down and the air from outside gushes in. This is inhalation.
To exhale, the diaphragm relaxes and becomes dome-shaped again; the chest cavity contracts due to the action of intercostal muscles, the volume inside the lungs decreases, pressure increases and the air is forced out of the lungs.
Inhaled air increases the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli,  so oxygen simply diffuses into the surrounding blood vessels.
Blood coming from cells has more concentration of carbon dioxide than outside air, and thus carbon dioxide simply diffuses out of the blood vessels into the alveoli.
Thus, breathing takes place due to the combined action of intercostal muscles and the diaphragm, while the exchange of gases takes place due to simple diffusion.
Life-Processes-10

 

Inhalation and Exhalation
The process of taking in air rich in oxygen is called inhalation.
Similarly, the process of giving out air rich in carbon dioxide is called exhalation.
One breath comprises one inhalation and one exhalation.
A person breathes several times a day.
The number of times a person breathes in one minute is termed as his/her breathing rate.
To know more about Inhalation and Exhalation, visit here.

Diffusion
Diffusion is the movement of molecules from high concentration area to the low concentration area without spending any energy.

Life-Processes-11

 

Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration is set of metabolic reactions occurring inside the cells to convert biochemical energy obtained from the food into a chemical compound called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

Metabolism refers to a set of chemical reactions carried out to maintain the living state of the cells in an organism. These can be divided into two categories:
Catabolism – the process of breaking molecules to obtain energy.
Anabolism – the process of synthesizing all compounds required by the cells.
Therefore, respiration is a catabolic process which breaks large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy to fuel cellular activities.
Glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain are the important processes of cellular respiration.
Life-Processes-12

 

To know more about Cellular Respiration, visit here.

Aerobic Respiration
Aerobic respiration is a process in which the food i.e. glucose is converted into energy in the presence of oxygen.

The general equation of aerobic respiration as a whole is given below-
Glucose + oxygen ⇒ Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy

This type of respiration takes place in animals, plants and other living organisms.
Respiration in Lower Animals
Lower animals lack a sophisticated respiratory system like lungs, alveoli etc.
Respiration in them takes place by simple exchange mechanisms.
Animals like earthworms take in gases through their skin.
Fishes have gills for gaseous exchange.
Insects have a tracheal system, which is a network of tubes through which air circulates and gaseous exchange takes place.
Frogs breathe through their skin when in water and through their lungs when on land.
Respiration in Cockroach

Respiration in Muscles
Respiration in muscles can be anaerobic when there is not enough oxygen.
Glucose gets broken down into carbon dioxide and lactic acid.
This results in the accumulation of lactic acid that makes the muscles sore.
This type of anaerobic respiration is also known as lactic acid fermentation.
ATP
It is the energy currency of the cell.
ATP stands for Adenosine Tri-Phosphate.
This molecule is created.; as a result, reactions like photosynthesis, respiration etc.
The three phosphate bonds present in the molecule are high-energy bonds, and when they are broken, a large amount of energy is released.
Such released energy is then used for other metabolic reactions.
Life-Processes-13

 

Respiration in Plants
Unlike animals and humans, plants do not have any specialized structures for gaseous exchange.
They have stomata (present in leaves) and lenticels (present in stems), which are involved in the exchange of gases.
Compared to animals, plant roots, stems, and leaves respire at a very lower rate.
Respiration In Plants

To know more about Respiration in Plants, visit here.

Transpiration
Transpiration

Transpiration is a biological process in which water is lost in the form of water vapour from the aerial parts of the plants.
This process occurs mainly through the stomata, where the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) occurs.
Transpiration helps in the transportation of water from roots to the upper parts of plants, and this is explained by the ‘transpirational pull theory’.
Loss of water, especially from leaves, acts as a straw effect and pulls water upwards from roots.
Transpiration also acts as an excretory mechanism in plants as it helps to get rid of excess water.
To know more about Transpiration, visit here.

Why Do We Need Lungs?
Human Lungs

In unicellular organisms like amoeba exchange of gases takes place through a general body surface by osmosis.
In lower animals like an earthworm, the gaseous exchange takes place through their moist skin.
The requirement for oxygen is sufficiently met in these ways.
But as the animal starts becoming more and more complex, for example, humans, the requirement for oxygen cannot be met alone by diffusion.
Moreover, diffusion will not be able to supply oxygen to the deep-seated cells.
This difficulty has led to the evolution of a more complex mechanism of gaseous exchange, and that is the development of lungs.
The alveoli present in the lungs provide a large surface area required for the necessary gas exchange.

Transportation in Human Beings
Transportation
All living organisms need a few necessary components like air, water, and food for their survival.
On a regular basis, animals ensure these elements by breathing, drinking and eating.
The required elements are transported to their body cells and tissues by a  transportation system.
In plants, the vascular tissue is responsible for transporting the substances.
Transportation in Humans
Transportation in humans is done by the circulatory system.
The circulatory system in humans mainly consists of blood, blood vessels and the heart.
It is responsible for the supply of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of carbon dioxide and other excretory products.
It also helps to fight infections.
Transportation in Humans

Heart
The muscular organ which is located near the chest, slightly towards the left in the thoracic region.
The heart is the main pumping organ of the body.
The human heart is divided into four chambers which are involved in the transportation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.
The upper two chambers are called atria, whereas the lower two chambers are called ventricles.
Life-Processes-14

To know more about Human Heart, visit here.

The flow of blood through the heart is as follows:
Life-Processes-15

Blood Vessels
Blood vessels carry blood throughout the body.
These three types of blood vessels are arteries, veins and blood capillaries.
Arteries carry oxygenated blood, and veins carry deoxygenated blood.
Gaseous exchange takes place between blood and cells at capillaries.
Difference between Arteries and Veins

Life-Processes-16

Life-Processes-17

 

Blood Pressure
The pressure exerted by the blood when it flows through the blood vessels is called blood pressure.

There are two different variants of blood pressure; systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
The pressure exerted on the walls of arteries when the heart is filling with blood is called diastolic pressure. It constitutes the minimum pressure on arteries.
The normal range of diastolic blood pressure should be 60 – 80 mm Hg.
The pressure exerted on the walls of arteries when the heart is pumping the blood is called systolic pressure. It constitutes the maximum pressure applied to the arteries.
The normal range of systolic blood pressure should be 90 – 120 mm Hg.
To know more about Blood Pressure, visit here.

Bleeding
Bleeding occurs when the blood vessels rupture.
Bleeding is stopped by the platelets that help in the clotting of blood at the site of the injury.
Blood Clotting is the process of forming a clot in order to prevent excess loss of blood from the body.
It is a gel-like mass which is formed by the platelets and a fibre-like protein in the blood.
Double Circulation
In the human body, blood circulates through the heart twice.
Once it goes through the heart during pulmonary circulation and a second time during systemic circulation.
Hence, circulation in human beings is called double circulation.
Life-Processes-18

Transportation in Plants
Transportation in Plants
Transportation is a vital process in plants.
The process involves the transportation of water and necessary nutrients to all parts of the plant for its survival.
Food and water transportation takes place separately in plants.
Xylem transports water, and phloem transports food.
Life-Processes-19

 

To know more about Transportation in Plants, visit here.

Phloem
The phloem is responsible for the translocation of nutrients and sugar, like carbohydrates, produced by the leaves to areas of the plant that are metabolically active.
Sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibres, and phloem parenchyma cells are the components of this tissue.
The flow of material through the phloem is bidirectional.
Life-Processes-20

 

Translocation
The transport of food in the plant through phloem via a process such as mass flow is called translocation.
Photosynthates, i.e. sugars and organic molecules such as amino acids, organic acids, proteins and inorganic solutes like potassium, magnesium, nitrate, calcium, sulfur and iron from source tissues (mature leaves) to the sink cells (areas of growth and storage) are transported through the phloem.
Material like sucrose is loaded from leaves to phloem using the energy of ATP.
Such a transfer increases the osmotic pressure causing the movement of water from nearby cells into phloem tissue, and the material gets transported through the phloem.
The same pressure is also responsible for the transfer of substances from the phloem to tissues where food is required.
Thus the bulk flow of material through phloem takes place in response to an osmotically generated pressure difference.
Life-Processes-21

 

Xylem
Xylem tissue transports water in plants from the root to all other parts of the plant.
Xylem tissue is made up of tracheids, vessels, xylem fibres and xylem parenchyma.
The flow of water and minerals through the xylem is always unidirectional.
Life-Processes-22

Life-Processes-23

Root Pressure
Conduction of water through the xylem, from roots to upper parts of plants, is due to many forces acting together.
One of the forces responsible for this is root pressure.
Root pressure is osmotic pressure within the cells of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.
Root pressure helps in the initial transport of water up the roots.
To know more about Root Pressure, visit here.

Transport of Water
Water is absorbed by the roots and is transported by the xylem to the upper parts of the plant.
Imbibition, osmosis, root pressure and transpiration are the forces that contribute towards the upward movement of water, even in the tallest plants.

Imbibition is a process in which water is absorbed by solids. E.g. seeds take up water when soaked.
Osmosis is a process where water moves from the area of its lower concentration to the area of its higher concentration.
At the roots, the cells take up ions by an active process, and this results in the difference in concentration of these ions.
It leads to the movement of water, in the root cells, by osmosis.
This creates a continuous column of water that gets pushed upwards. This is root pressure.
Transpiration contributes to the upward movement of water by creating a staw effect.
It pulls the water column upwards as there is a continuous loss of water from leaves.
All these forces act together for water transport through the xylem
Excretion in Humans
Excretion
Excretion is the process of removal of metabolic waste material and other non-useful substances.

Organisms like animals have an advanced and specialized system for excretion.
But plants lack a well-developed excretory system like that in animals.
They do not have special organs for excretion, and thus excretion in plants is not so complex.
Excretion in Unicellular Organisms
In unicellular organisms such as amoeba and bacteria, the waste product is removed by simple diffusion through the general body surface.
Unicellular organisms like the amoeba and paramecium excrete excess through tiny organelles called contractile vacuoles.
Undigested food in unicellular animals is excreted when the food vacuole merges with the general body surface and opens to the outside.
Excretory System of Humans
The excretory system in humans includes
a pair of kidneys,
a pair of ureters,
a urinary bladder and
urethra.
It produces urine as a waste product.
Life-Processes-24

To know more about Human Excretory System, visit here.

Kidneys
Paired kidneys are the main excretory organs of the body.
They are basically the filtration units of the human body.
Each kidney is made up of many tiny filtration units called nephrons.
Kidneys perform crucial functions like:
Filtering waste materials, medications, and toxic substances from the blood.
Regulation of osmolarity, i.e. the fluid balance of the body.
Regulation of ion concentration in the body.
Regulation of pH.
Regulation of extracellular fluid volume.
Secreting hormones that help produce red blood cells promotes bone health and regulates blood pressure.
Nephron
Nephrons are the structural and functional unit of kidney.

Each kidney has millions of nephrons, and it forms the basic structural and functional unit of the kidney.
Each nephron has two parts: The malpighian body and the renal tubule.
The malpighian body is made up of a cup-like structure called Bowman’s capsule, which encloses a bunch of capillaries called the glomerulus.
They together filter waste materials along with many useful substances.
The renal tubule has regions called a proximal convoluted tubule, Loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule.
These regions absorb useful substances back into the blood and also filter the remaining waste substances.
The output from nephrons is called urine.
Life-Processes-25

 

Haemodialysis
When the kidneys fail, it results in a lot of complications, and to compensate for this situation, a technology called dialysis has been developed.
It uses a machine filter called a dialyzer or artificial kidney.
This is to remove excess water and salt, balance other electrolytes in the body and remove waste products of metabolism.
Blood from the body is removed and flows through a series of tubes made up of a semipermeable membrane.
A dialysate flows on the other side of the membrane, which draws impurities through the membrane.
Life Processes-26 

Excretion in Plants
Cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and other metabolic reactions produce a lot of excretory products in plants.
Carbon dioxide, excess water produced during respiration and nitrogenous compounds produced during protein metabolism are the major excretory products in plants.
Plants produce two gaseous waste products, i.e. oxygen during photosynthesis and carbon dioxide during respiration.
The excretion of gaseous waste in plants takes place through stomatal pores on leaves.
Oxygen released during photosynthesis is used for respiration, while carbon dioxide released during respiration is used for photosynthesis.
Excess water is excreted by transpiration.
Organic by-products generated by the plant are stored in different forms in different parts.
The gums, oils, latex, resins, etc., are some waste products stored in plant parts like bark, stems, leaves, etc.
Eventually, plants shed off these parts.
A few examples of the excretory products of plants are oil produced from oranges, eucalyptus, jasmine, latex from the rubber tree, papaya tree, and gums from acacia.
Sometimes plants even excrete into the soil.

            Introduction
The human body is a complex machine performing tons of functions and processes to maintain and sustain life. Explore how the body controls its movements and coordinates its actions with other parts of the body and the environment by exploring notes for Class 10 Chapter 7 Control and Coordination.

The Nervous System
Movement in Organisms
The ability of organisms to move certain body parts is movement.

When they move from one place to another, it is called locomotion.

Organisms show movements in response to stimuli.

Introduction to Control & Coordination
Organisms move in response to various kinds of stimuli like light, heat, nutrients/food, etc.
All the activities in animals are controlled and coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems.
Hormones are chemical messengers which assist the nervous system in carrying out various functions. They are secreted by endocrine glands.
Hormones in plants coordinate the movements.
For more information on Nervous System, watch the below video

The Nervous System
Nervous system types

Neuron
Neuron is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system.

Each neuron has three main parts: dendrites, cyton/soma/cell body and axon.
Dendrites receive impulses from other neurons.
Cyton/soma processes the impulse.
Axon transmits the impulse, either to another neuron or to muscles/glands, etc.
Axon may be myelinated or non-myelinated.
The impulse transmission is faster in myelinated neurons.
CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 7 - 1

Central Nervous System
The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. The functions of different parts of the brain are:

The cerebrum is responsible for reasoning, logic, emotions, speech, memory, visual processing, recognition of auditory and taste stimuli, etc.
Cerebellum regulates and coordinates body movements, posture and balance.
Pons relays signals from the hindbrain to the forebrain.
Medulla Oblongata controls all involuntary movements like vomiting, sneezing, yawning, heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, etc.
Medulla oblongata continues as the spinal cord, which runs through the vertebral column and it controls reflex actions.
CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 7 - 2

Read more: Central Nervous System

Peripheral Nervous System
The nerves coming out from the brain and the spinal cord constitute the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
There are 12 cranial nerves and 31 spinal nerves in humans.
Read more: Peripheral Nervous System

Somatic Nervous System
It forms a part of the PNS.
The nerves of PNS that control the voluntary actions of the body form the somatic nervous system.
Autonomic Nervous System
All the nerves of the PNS that control the involuntary actions in the body form the autonomic nervous system. E.g. respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, etc., are regulated by the autonomic nervous system.
Two divisions of the autonomic nervous system are the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for intense physical activity and is often referred to as the fight-or-flight response, while the parasympathetic nervous system has almost the exact opposite effect and relaxes the body and inhibits or slows many high-energy functions.
Reflex Action
Reflex action is a sudden, involuntary reaction of the body in response to stimuli.

To know more about Reflex Action, visit here.

Reflex Arc
It is the path followed by an electrical impulse during a reflex action.
The impulse travels from the receptor organ to the spinal cord/brain. It is processed there, and the information is brought back to the concerned muscle to carry out the action.
Thus, the receptor organ, sensory/afferent neuron, interneuron, motor/efferent neuron and effector organ are the components of a reflex arc.
CBSE Class 10 Science notes Chapter 7 - 3

Protection of CNS
The brain is protected by 3 main layers –

The bony skull (cranium)
The cerebrospinal fluid
The meninges (Dura mater, Arachnoid and Pia mater).

Plant Hormones and Movements
Plant Hormones
Control and coordination in plants are carried out by hormones.

Plant Hormone 	 Function
Auxin	Helps in the growth of plant tissues
Cytokinin	Promotes cell division, delays ageing of cells
Gibberellins	Helps in the growth of stems, initiates seed germination, promotes flowering, cell division and seed growth after germination
Abscisic acid	Inhibits growth and causes wilting of leaves, promotes dormancy of buds and seeds
Ethylene	This is a gaseous hormone which causes the ripening of fruits
To know more about Plant hormones, visit here.

Growth Independent Movements
The movements which are not growth related are called nastic movements. These movements occur in response to environmental stimuli but the direction of response is not dependent on the direction of the stimulus.

The movement in the touch-me-not plant is thigmonastic movement (movement in response to touch).
Thigmonasty

Growth-Related Movements in Plants
The movements which are growth related are called tropic movements. These movements occur in response to environmental stimuli and the direction of the response is dependent on the direction of the stimulus.

For more information on Tropic Movements in Plants, watch the below video


35,179
To know more about Tropic Movements in Plants, visit here.

Examples:

Phototropic movement (light-dependent)
Geotropic movement (gravity-dependent)
Chemotropic movement (chemical-dependent)
Hydrotropic movement (water-dependent)
Thigmotropic movement (touch dependent)
Geotropism
Movement of plant parts in response to earth’s gravitational force is known as geotropism/gravitropism.

Towards gravity – positive geotropism
Away from gravity – negative geotropism
The root grows towards gravity, and the shoot grows away from gravity
Geotropism

 

Phototropism
Movement of plant parts in response to light is known as phototropism.

Towards light-positive phototropism.
Away from light – negative phototropism.
Stems move towards the light, and roots move away from the light.
To know more about Phototropism, visit here.

Hydrotropism
Movement of plant parts in response to water or moisture.

Towards water-positive hydrotropism.
Away from water – negative hydrotropism.
Again, root movement in search of water is positive hydrotropism.
E.g. movement of roots towards high humidity level.
Hydrotropism

Chemotropism
Movement of plant parts in response to chemical stimuli is known as chemotropism.

Towards chemical-positive chemotropism.
Away from chemical-negative chemotropism.
The growth of the pollen tube towards the ovule is positive chemotropism.
Thigmotropism
Movement of plant parts in response to touch is called as thigmotropism.

Towards touch – Positive thigmotropism.
Away from touch – negative thigmotropism.
Movement of tendrils around the support is positive thigmotropism.
THIGMOTROPISM

The Endocrine System
Exocrine Glands
Exocrine glands are glands that discharge secretions by means of  ducts, which open onto an epithelial surface.

 

Endocrine Glands
Endocrine glands are the ductless glands which secrete hormones into the bloodstream in humans.

The endocrine glands present in the human body are the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, pineal, pancreas, ovary (female), testis (male), etc. Let us now learn more about each of the glands below.

The Endocrine System

For more information on Endocrine Glands, watch the below video


92,705
To know more about Exocrine glands, visit here.

Pituitary Gland
It is a pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain.
It is the master gland, as it controls the secretions of all the other endocrine glands.
It also secretes Growth Hormone (GH). Under-secretion of GH causes Dwarfism, and over-secretion causes Gigantism in children and ‘Acromegaly’ in adults.
To know more about the Pituitary gland, visit here.

Thyroid Gland
It is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the throat.
It secretes the hormone ‘Thyroxine’, which regulates the metabolism of the body.
Iodine is required to synthesize thyroxine in the body.
In the case of iodine deficiency, under-secretion of thyroxine leads to goitre.
To know more about the Thyroid gland, visit here.

Pancreas
It is a leaf-like gland present behind the stomach in the abdomen.
It is an endocrine as well an exocrine gland.
As an endocrine gland, it manufactures two hormones – Insulin and glucagon. Both these hormones act antagonistically and regulate the sugar level in the blood.
As an exocrine gland, it secretes enzymes to break down the proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids in food.
An insufficient amount of insulin from the pancreas leads to diabetes.
To know more about Pancreas, visit here.

Adrenal Gland
Occurs in pairs above each kidney.
It decreases in size with age.
Secrets the hormone adrenaline, which helps in flight and fight response.
Also secretes noradrenaline.
To know more about the Adrenal gland, visit here.

Gonads
Gonads are the gamete-producing organs – testes in males and ovaries in females.
The testes produce the male hormone testosterone, and the ovaries produce the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone.
Testosterone and oestrogen help in producing gametes and are responsible for the sexual characteristics of males and females, respectively.
Progesterone is the pregnancy hormone.
To know more about Gonads, visit here.

Other Endocrine Organs
The other endocrine organs include the hypothalamus, parathyroid, pineal and thymus glands.

            Introduction
All living organisms multiply or reproduce and produce offspring of a similar kind. Reproduction is an essential process for the existence of a species and the continuation of life.

Here, in this chapter, we will learn about how different unicellular and multicellular organisms, such as bacteria, algae, plants, animals, and human beings, reproduce. Learn what the different reproductive structures are and about the modes of reproduction, such as cell division, vegetative reproduction, asexual reproduction, and sexual reproduction.

Asexual Reproduction
Asexual reproduction is a method of reproduction that involves only one organism. A single organism reproduces two or multiple organisms on its own. This is seen in all unicellular organisms, some multicellular organisms and a few plants.

For more information on Plant Reproduction, watch the below video

Sexual Reproduction
The mode of reproduction involves two individuals; one male and one female. They produce sex cells or gametes, which fuse to form a new organism.

To know more about Sexual reproduction, visit here.

Asexual Reproduction
Fission
Fission is an asexual reproduction that is common in most unicellular organisms.
When the fission results in two daughter cells, it is binary fission (e.g. paramecium).
When fission results in many daughter cells, it is called multiple fission (e.g. Plasmodium).
Planes of fission may be different for different organisms.

Budding
Budding is a type of asexual reproduction in which a small cyst-like structure is formed on the parent’s body, which gives rise to a new individual.
Bud may remain attached to the parent (yeast) or may separate and become a new individual (hydra).

Regeneration and Fragmentation
Regeneration is the process of growing back the lost organ or body part by the organism (e.g. lizard).
Fragmentation is the process by which an organism gets fragmented into smaller pieces, and each piece grows into a whole new organism.
E.g. Planaria, Hydra

Spore Formation
Organisms such as fungi make spores that can grow into completely new individuals when dispersed from their fruiting bodies. Spores are produced inside sporangia. They are covered by a thick outer layer that protects them in adverse conditions. When spores get suitable environmental conditions, they germinate and begin to grow.

Vegetative Propagation
Vegetative propagation by roots

This is a type of asexual reproduction seen in plants.
The vegetative parts of the plant, like leaves, stems, and roots, give rise to a new plant.
Vegetative propagation can be artificial or natural.
Natural vegetative propagation happens through leaves (e.g. bryophyllum), stem (e.g. turmeric, ginger), runners/stolon (e.g. grass runners, strawberry), bulbs ( e.g. onion, lily), etc.
Artificial methods include cutting, grafting, layering and plant tissue culture.
To know more about Vegetative propagation, visit here.

Sexual Reproduction
Types of Cell Division
Types of Cell Division

Two types of cell division are seen in eukaryotic organisms:

Mitosis

Takes place in somatic cells
Maintains the chromosome number
Produces two, diploid daughter cells
Required for asexual reproduction, development and growth, cell replacement and  regeneration
Meiosis

Takes place in sex cells
Reduces the number of chromosomes by half
Produces four haploid daughter cells
Required for sexual reproduction, i.e gamete formation
To know more about Cell division, visit here.

The Reproductive System
In humans, there is a remarkable difference in the male and female reproductive systems. Testes are the main reproductive structure in males where sperms (male gametes) are produced, and ovum (female gamete) is produced inside the ovary. Let us now learn in detail about male and female reproductive systems in humans.

To know more about Human Reproductive System, visit here.

Male Reproductive System
The main reproductive organ in males is a pair of testes.
They produce the male sex cells called sperms and also produce the male sex hormone testosterone.
 

Male reproductive system

Male Primary Reproductive Organ

The main reproductive organ in males is a pair of testes.
They are present in scrotal sacs outside the body and contain seminiferous tubules as the structural and functional unit.
Male sex cells, sperms, are produced by seminiferous tubules and mature in the epididymis.
Leydig cells or interstitial cells present in between the seminiferous tubules secrete the hormone testosterone.
Male Accessory Reproductive Organs
Several accessory reproductive organs aid in the reproductive process.
The prostate gland and the seminal vesicles are glands of the reproductive system which make semen and nourish the sperm.
Penis, having the urethra passing through it, is called a copulatory organ.
Male Ducts
In males, the vas deferens and the urethra are the main ducts.
A single vas deferens carries sperm from the respective testis up to the urethra.
The urethra acts as a common passage for semen and urine.
To know more about Male Reproductive System, visit here.

Female Reproductive System
The human female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair of fallopian tubes/oviducts and the accessory organs such as the uterus and the vagina.

Female Reproductive System

Female Primary Reproductive Organ
The main reproductive organ in a female is a pair of ovaries.
They produce the female sex cells called eggs or ova and also produce female sex hormones called estrogen and progesterone.
Female Accessory Reproductive Organ
The uterus, oviducts, and vagina are the accessory reproductive organs in human females.
The uterus is the site of fetal development, and the vagina receives sperm from the male. Ovum is carried from the ovaries to the uterus through a pair of oviducts.
To know more about the Female reproductive system, visit here.

Menstrual Cycle
Menstruation
Menstruation is the cyclic event of the release of the ovum from the ovary and its removal from the body when fertilization does not happen.
During menstruation, the blood-rich endometrium of the uterus also breaks down while the ovum is removed from the body.
Two pituitary hormones, LH and FSH, and two ovarian hormones, estrogen and progesterone, all have their roles in menstruation.
In humans, the cycle repeats every 28 days.
To know more about Menstrual Cycle, visit here.

Fertilization
Human Reproduction
Humans reproduce sexually. The male produces sperms and the female produces eggs. When the sperm fuses with the egg, it forms a zygote that gives rise to a new progeny.

To know more about Fertilization, visit here.

Contraceptive Methods
Types of contraception

Reproductive Health
Reproductive health deals with the prevention of STDs and unwanted pregnancy. Understanding the reproductive system is also a part of reproductive health awareness.

Contraceptives
Contraceptives are devices that prevent unwanted pregnancy and help avoid STDs.
Contraceptives can be of various types such as mechanical barriers, hormonal/chemical methods, surgical methods, etc.
Coitus Interruptus
It is a very unreliable contraceptive method where the coitus is stopped before the male ejaculates inside the female reproductive tracts.
Rhythm Method
Another unreliable method of contraception is where coitus is avoided when the female is fertile and the chances of fertilization are very high.
Condoms
One of the most effective methods of contraception.
A mechanical barrier that stops the semen from entering the female tract preventing pregnancy.
It also avoids the possibility of contracting STDs.
Diaphragms
Diaphragms are barriers that can be added inside the female reproductive tracts.
They stop the entry of semen inside the female tract and thus prevent pregnancy.
Contraceptive Pills
Contraceptive pills are chemical methods of contraception.
They change the level of hormones in the body that prevents the release of the ovum from the ovaries.
Emergency Pill
Emergency pills are those pills which can be taken after coitus to avoid pregnancy.
They quickly change the level of hormones in the body and prevent a successful implantation even if the egg gets fertilized.
IUD
IUD stands for Intrauterine Device.
They can be used for a couple of years.
It is a device that is inserted into the uterus, changing its shape and preventing successful implantation of the zygote.
Sterilization
Sterilization is a surgical method of going permanently sterile.
This can be done in both males and females.
In males, it is called vasectomy and in females, it is called tubal ligation.
To know more about Contraceptive Methods, visit here.

Reproduction in Plants
Plants reproduce by both asexual and sexual methods. Vegetative propagation is a type of asexual reproduction in plants. Let’s learn now about sexual reproduction in plants.

To know more about Reproduction in Plants, visit here.

Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants
Sexual reproduction in plants happens through flowers.
Essential whorls of the flowers such as androecium and gynoecium help in the sexual reproduction of plants.
Read more:  Sexual Reproduction in Plants

Non-Essential Parts of Flowers
The typical structure of flowers contains essential whorls and non-essential whorls.
Sepals and Petals are called non-essential whorls as they do not directly take part in reproduction.
Sepals protect the inner delicate whorl during bud condition and also perform photosynthesis if they are green in colour.
Petals, when they are coloured, attract insects for pollination.
Essential Whorls of Flowers
Androecium and gynoecium are called essential/reproductive whorls of a flower.
Androecium produces pollen grains containing male gametes, and gynoecium produces ovules which are female gametes.
Bisexual flowers contain both whorls, while unisexual flowers contain either of them.
Each individual member of androecium is called a stamen and consists of an anther and filament.
Anther produces haploid pollen grains.
Each individual member of the gynoecium is called a pistil and consists of a stigma, style and ovary.
CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 8-7
Pollination
The process of transfer of pollen grains from anthers to the stigma of a flower is known as pollination.

It is required for fertilization.
Pollination has two types, self-pollination (autogamy) and cross-pollination (allogamy).
In self-pollination, the transfer of pollen grains takes place from anthers to the stigma of the same flower or another flower of the same plant.
In cross-pollination, pollens are transferred from anthers to the stigma of another flower.
Many pollinating agents play their roles in cross-pollination. Examples: water, wind, insects, birds, bats, etc.
Know more: Pollination

Fertilization
Fusion of male and female gametes is known as fertilization.

In flowering plants, after pollination, the pollens germinate on the stigma surface of the pistil and generate two male nuclei.
Ovule has an egg cell and two polar nuclei.
One male nucleus fuses with two polar nuclei and forms a triploid endosperm.
Another male nucleus fuses with the egg cell and forms the zygote that gives rise to the embryo and future plant.
After fertilization, the ovary becomes the fruit, and the ovules turn into seeds. All other parts wither away.

            Introduction to Light – Reflection & Refraction
In Class 10 Science Chapter 10 Light, the phenomena of reflection and refraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light are taught to students. Furthermore, optical phenomena in nature are examined. The reflection of light by spherical mirrors is discussed in the chapter so that their applications are studied in real-life situations.

Chapter Summary Video

Light: Definition
Light is a form of energy that enables us to see things. Light starts from a source and bounces off objects which are perceived by our eyes, and our brain processes this signal, which eventually enables us to see. Maxwell predicted that magnetic and electric fields travel in the form of waves, and these waves move at the speed of light. This led Maxwell to predict that light itself was carried by electromagnetic waves, which means that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.

For more information on Introduction to Light, watch the below video

Nature of Light
Light behaves as a:

ray, e.g. reflection
wave, e.g. interference and diffraction
particle, e.g. photoelectric effect
Dual Nature of Light

According to the concept of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics, light exhibits both particle and wave nature, depending upon the circumstances. A phenomenon like diffraction, polarisation and interference could be explained by considering light as a wave. A phenomenon like the photoelectric effect is explained by assuming that light consists of particles called photons.

Laws of Reflection
Light Incident on the Surface Separating Two Media
When light travels from one medium to another medium it either:

gets absorbed (absorption)
bounces back (reflection)
passes through or bends (refraction)
When light is incident on a plane mirror, most of it gets reflected, and some of it gets absorbed in the medium.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 10-1

Characteristics of Light
The speed of light is given as c=λμ, where λ is its wavelength and μ is its frequency.
The speed of light is a constant which is 2.998×108m/s or approximately 3.0×108m/s.
To know more about Properties of Light, visit here.

Reflection of Light by Other Media
A medium that is polished well without any irregularities on its surface will cause regular reflection of light. For example, a plane mirror. But even then, some light gets absorbed by the surface.

Laws of Reflection
The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal all lie in the same plane.  Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection
[∠i=∠r]

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 10-2

For more information on Laws of Reflection, watch the below video


2,63,186
To know more about the Law of Reflection, visit here.

Propagation of Light
Rectilinear propagation of light: Light travels in a straight line between any two points.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 10-3

Fermat’s Principle
The principle of least time: Light always takes the quickest path between any two points (which may not be the shortest path).
Rectilinear propagation of light and the law of reflection  [∠i=∠r] can be validated by Fermat’s principle of least time.
Applications of Fermat’s Principle
We can make several observations as a result of Fermat’s Principle, which will prove useful as we explore the realm of geometric optics:

In a homogeneous medium, light rays are rectilinear. That is, in any medium where the index of refraction is constant, light travels in a straight line.
The angle of reflection of a surface is equal to the angle of incidence. This is the Law of Reflection.
Example of Fermat’s Principle
Mirage is an example of this phenomenon. Sometimes, we feel like we are seeing water on the road, but when we get there, the road is dry. What we really witness is the light of the sky, which is reflected on the road. Since the air is very hot just above the road, but it is cooler up higher. Hot air expands more than cool air and is thinner, this leads to less decrease in the speed of light.

Students can refer to the short notes and MCQ questions along with separate solutions based on this chapter for quick revision from the links below:

Plane Mirror
Any flat and polished surface that has almost no irregularities on its surface that reflect light is called a plane mirror.
Plane Mirror

Image Formation by a Plane Mirror
The image formed by a plane mirror is always virtual and erect.
Object and image are equidistant from the mirror.
CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 10-4

Characteristics of Images
Images can be real or virtual, erect or inverted, magnified or diminished. A real image is formed by the actual convergence of light rays. A virtual image is an apparent convergence of diverging light rays.
If an image formed is upside down, then it is called inverted or else it is an erect image. If the image formed is bigger than the object, then it is called magnified. If the image formed is smaller than the object, then it is diminished.

Principle of Reversibility of Light
If the direction of a ray of light is reversed due to reflection off a surface, then it will retrace its path.

Spherical Mirrors
Spherical Mirror
Consider a hollow sphere with a very smooth and polished inside surface and an outer surface with a coating of mercury so that no light can come out. Then if we cut a thin slice out of the shell, we get a curved mirror, which is called a spherical mirror.
Spherical Mirror

Relationship between Focus and Radius of Curvature
Focal length is half the distance between the pole and the radius of curvature.

F = R/2

Relationship between focus and radius of curvature

Curved Mirror
A mirror (or any polished, reflective surface) with a curvature is known as a curved mirror.

Important Terms Related to Spherical Mirror
Terms Related to Spherical Mirror

Pole (P): The midpoint of a spherical mirror.
Centre of curvature (C): The centre of the sphere that the spherical mirror was a part of.
The radius of curvature (r): The distance between the centre of curvature and the spherical mirror. This radius will intersect the mirror at the pole (P).
Principal Axis: The line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature is the main or principal axis.
Concave Mirror: A spherical mirror with a reflecting surface that bulges inwards.
Convex Mirror: A spherical mirror with a reflecting surface that bulges outwards.
Focus (F): Take a concave mirror. All rays parallel to the principal axis converge at a point between the pole and the centre of curvature. This point is called the focal point or focus.
Focal length: Distance between pole and focus.
Rules of Ray Diagram for Representation of Images Formed
 A ray passing through the centre of curvature hits the concave spherical mirror and retraces its path.
Rays parallel to the principal axis passes through the focal point or focus.
Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors
For objects at various positions, the image formed can be found using the ray diagrams for the special two rays. The following table is for a concave mirror.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 10-6

Uses of SphericalMirror based on the Image Formed
Concave and Convex mirrors are used for many daily purposes.
Example: Rear view mirrors in vehicles, lamps, solar cookers.
Uses of Concave Mirror

Mirror Formula and Magnification
1/v + 1/u = 1/f
where ‘u’ is object distance, ‘v’ is the image distance and ‘f’ is the focal length of the spherical mirror, which is found by the similarity of triangles.

The magnification produced by a spherical mirror is the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object. It is usually represented as ‘m’.

Sign Convention for Ray Diagram
Distances measured towards positive x and y axes (coordinate system) are positive, and towards negative, x and y-axes are negative. Keep in mind the origin is the pole (P). Usually, the height of the object is taken as positive as it is above the principal axis, and the height of the image is taken as negative as it is below the principal axis.

Position and Size of Image Formed
The size of the image can be found using the magnification formula m = h’/h = – (v/u). If m is -ve it is a real image and if it is +ve it is a virtual image.

Refraction Through a Glass Slab and Refractive Index
Refraction
The shortest path need not be the quickest path. Since light is always in a hurry, it bends when it enters a different medium as it is still following the quickest path. This phenomenon of light bending in a different medium is called refraction.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 10-7

Laws of Refraction
The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of refraction.
To know more about Refraction and the Law of Refraction, visit here.

Absolute and Relative Refractive Index
The refractive index of one medium with respect to another medium is called the relative refractive index. When taken with respect to a vacuum, it’s known as an absolute refractive index.

Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab
When the light is incident on a rectangular glass slab, it emerges out parallel to the incident ray and is laterally displaced. It moves from rarer to a denser medium and then again to a rarer medium.

Refraction at a Planar Surface
Refraction of Light through Planar Surface
Following Snell’s Law:

Light bends towards the normal when moving from rarer to denser medium at the surface of the two media.
Light bends away from the normal when moving from denser to rarer medium at the surface of contact of the two media.
Refractive Index
The extent to which light bends when moving from one medium to another is called the refractive index. This depends on the ratio of the speeds in the two media. The greater the ratio, the more the bending. It is also the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence and the sine of the angle of refraction, which is a constant for any given pair of media. It is denoted by:
n = sin∠i/sin∠r = speed of light in medium 1/speed of light in medium2.

The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of monochromatic light in the substance of interest is known as the relative refractive index. Mathematically, it is represented as:
n = c/v
Where n is the refractive index of a medium, c is the velocity of light in a vacuum and v is the velocity of light in that particular medium.

Total Internal Reflection
Total Internal Reflection

When the light goes from a denser to a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal. The angle at which the incident ray causes the refracted ray to go along the surface of the two media parallelly is called the critical angle.
When the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, it reflects inside the denser medium instead of refracting. This phenomenon is known as Total Internal Reflection.
E.g. mirages, and optical fibres.

Spherical Lens
Refraction at Curved Surfaces
When light is incident on a curved surface and passes through, the laws of refraction still hold true, for example, lenses.

Spherical Lenses
Spherical lenses are lenses formed by binding two spherical transparent surfaces together. Spherical lenses formed by binding two spherical surfaces bulging outward are known as convex lenses while spherical lenses formed by binding two spherical surfaces such that they are curved inward are known as concave lenses.

            Structure of a Human Eye
Of all the sense organs, the human eye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful, colourful world around us. The eye is spherical in shape and has a diameter of 2.3 cm on average. The internal structure of the eye includes- the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, ciliary muscles, retina, nerve cells, optic nerve, yellow spot, aqueous and vitreous humor, and suspensory ligament.

Human Eye

The lens system of the human eye forms an image on the light-sensitive screen called the retina. The cornea is the thin membrane of the eye through which light enters. Most of the light refraction occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. A dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil, known as the Iris is present behind the cornea. The pupil is a structure in the eye that controls and regulates the amount of light entering the eye. The light-sensitive cells get triggered upon illumination and induce electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain through the optic nerves. The brain analyses these signals and, finally, processes the information so that we sense objects as they are.

Defects of a Human Eye
There are few common eye disorders seen in all individuals, and they are caused by several factors. These conditions can be improved by the corrections. The defects include:

Myopia – This is also called short-sightedness. A person with this eye defect can only see nearby objects clearly compared to distant objects. This condition can be corrected using a concave lens.

Myopia Ray Diagram

Hypermetropia – This is also called farsightedness. A person with this eye defect can only see distant objects clearly compared to near objects. This condition can be corrected using a convex lens.

Hypermetropia and its Correction

To know more about Hypermetropia, visit here.

Presbyopia – This is an age-related condition caused due to the weakening of ciliary muscles, hardening of the lens, and reduced lens flexibility. A person with this defect usually finds difficulties focusing on nearby objects and is unable to read or write.

Cataract – This is an age-related condition caused due to the loss of transparency of the lens by erosion of lens proteins. It usually results in blurry vision and cloudy lenses and can be corrected by replacing the old lens with an artificial lens.

Dispersion of White Light by a Glass Prism
A prism splits the incident white light into a band of seven colours. The band of the coloured components of a light beam is called its spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the sunlight spectrum. Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray as they pass through a prism. The red light bends the least while the violet the most. Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct.

Dispersion of White Light

Atmospheric Refraction
The refraction of light by the Earth’s atmosphere is known as atmospheric refraction. Atmospheric refraction is caused by the bending of light rays when they pass through the layers of the earth’s atmosphere, which are of different optical densities.

Twinkling of Stars
The twinkling effect of stars is due to the atmospheric refraction of starlight. The starlight undergoes continuous refraction as it passes through the atmosphere before it reaches Earth. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates, and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers.

Scattering of Light
When a light beam goes through a medium, it hits the particles existing in them. Due to this phenomenon, some of the light rays get absorbed while a few get scattered in various directions. The intensity of the scattered light rays depends on the particles’ size and wavelength.

Frequently Asked Questions on The Human Eye and the Colourful World
Q1
If Ram is facing west and he sees a rainbow in front of him, in which direction most probably the Sun is?
The Sun and the rainbow will always be in opposite directions. A Rainbow is formed when a raindrop causes the light from the Sun to undergo partial internal reflection. This means that the light is reflected back in the direction it came from (from the Sun). Hence, we can see a rainbow only if our back is facing the Sun. Hence, in this case, the Sun will be in the east direction.

Q2
Which colour will be refracted the most when white light is dispersed from a
prism?
The refractive index of the medium is maximum for violet light and minimum for red light. Therefore, when white light enters a prism, it disperses into seven constituent colours, and violet light shows the maximum deviation.

Q3
Why can one not see through the fog?
Fog is a visible aerosol consisting of tiny water droplets or ice crystals that remain near the surface of the earth. When light travels through the fog, it interacts with the water droplets of the fog and is scattered by them. The scattering of light by fog droplets is not uniform in all directions. The light from various objects gets scattered by water droplets, so the eye cannot distinguish the objects, and thus one cannot see through the fog.

Magnetic Field and Field Lines
Magnet
A magnet is a material that produces a field that attracts or repels other such materials of magnetic nature.
Lodestone is a naturally occurring magnet. It attracts materials like Iron, Nickel, Cobalt, etc.

A magnet is always bipolar, with poles named north and south poles. These two poles always exist together and can not be separated. The north pole of a magnet is the side which points to the Earth’s geographic north when it is freely suspended.

Similar to charges, poles attract and repel. Like poles repel while unlike poles attract each other.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-1

To know more about Magnet, visit here.

Bar magnet
A bar magnet is a rectangular object composed of iron, steel or any form of a ferromagnetic substance that shows permanent magnetic properties. It has two different poles, a north and a south pole, such that when suspended freely, the north pole aligns itself towards the geographic north pole of the Earth.
Bar Magnet

Magnetic Field
The region around a magnet where its magnetic influence can be experienced is called a magnetic field. The direction and strength of a magnetic field are represented by magnetic lines of force.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-2

For more information on Magnetic Field and Magnet Field Lines, watch the below video

To know more about Magnetic Field, visit here.

Magnetic Field Lines
A magnet’s magnetic field lines result in the formation of continuous/running closed loops.
The tangent to the field line at any given point indicates the direction of the total magnetic field at that point.
The greater the number of field lines crossing per unit area, the higher the intensity and the stronger the magnitude of the magnetic field.
There is no intersection between the magnetic field lines.
CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-4

Magnetic Field Lines for a Closed Loop
Since magnets have dipoles, magnetic field lines must originate and end. Therefore by convention, it starts at the north pole and moves towards the south pole outside the bar magnet and from south → north inside the magnet. Hence, it forms closed loops. The closer or denser the magnetic field lines, the greater the magnetic field’s strength.

Iron Filings Test around a Bar Magnet
Iron filings around a bar magnet exhibit the magnetic field lines that engirdle the bar magnet. The magnetic field lines can be explained as imaginary lines that graphically represent the magnetic field that is acting around any magnetic substance.
CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-3
Magnetic field lines do not intersect as there will be two tangential magnetic field directions associated with the same point, which does not occur. If a compass needle is placed at that point, it will show two different directions of the magnetic field, which is absurd.
To know more about the Properties of Magnetic Field Lines, visit here.

Magnetic Field Due to a Current Carrying Conductor
Oersted’s Experiment
When electric current flows through a current-carrying conductor, it produces a magnetic field around it. This can be seen with the help of a magnetic needle which shows deflection. The more the current, the higher the deflection. If the direction of the current is reversed, the direction of deflection is also reversed.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-5

Electromagnetism and Electromagnet
An electromagnet is an artificial magnet which produces a magnetic field on the passage of electric current through a conductor. This field disappears when the current is turned off. The phenomenon of producing or inducing a magnetic field due to the passage of electric current is called electromagnetism.

To know more about the Magnetic field due to current-carrying conductors, visit here.

Right-Hand Thumb Rule
If a straight conductor is held in the right hand in such a way that the thumb points along the direction of the current, then the tips of the fingers or the curl of the fingers show the direction of the magnetic field around it.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-8

Magnetic Field Due to Current through a Circular Loop
The right-hand thumb rule can be used for a circular conducting wire as well as it comprises of small straight segments. Every point on the wire carrying current gives rise to a magnetic field that appears as straight lines at the centre.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-9

Magnetic Field Due to Current in a Solenoid
A solenoid is a coil of many circular windings wrapped in the shape of a cylinder. When current is passed through it, it behaves similarly to a bar magnet, producing a very similar field pattern as that of a bar magnet. To increase the strength, a soft iron core is used.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-10

Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor in a Magnetic Field
Ampere’s Experiment
When an electric conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force is directly proportional to the current and is also perpendicular to its length and magnetic field.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-11

Force on a straight current-carrying conductor is mutually perpendicular to the magnetic field and the direction of the current.

To know more about Magnetic Force, visit here.
Also Read: Magnetic Field in a Solenoid Formula

Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule
Fleming’s left-hand rule states that the direction of force applied to a current-carrying wire is perpendicular to both the direction of current as well as the magnetic field.

To know more about Fleming’s left-hand rule and Fleming’s right-hand rule, visit here.

Electric Motor
An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-13

Current enters arm AB through brush X, and current flows through brush Y from C to D. Using Fleming’s LHR, we find that the force pushes AB downwards and pushes CD upwards.
In an electric motor, the split rings PQ act as a commutator that reverses the direction of the current. The reversing of the current is repeated at each half-rotation, giving rise to a continuous rotation of the coil.
To know more about Electric motor, visit here.

Electromagnetic Induction and Electric Generators
Faraday’s Experiment
Faraday discovered that a magnetic field interacts with an electric circuit by inducing a voltage known as EMF (electromotive force) by electromagnetic induction.
Moving a magnet towards a coil sets up a current in the coil circuit, as indicated by deflection in the galvanometer needle.
CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-14

Electromagnetic Induction
The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is the production of induced EMF and, thereby, current in a coil due to the varying magnetic field with time. If a coil is placed near a current-carrying conductor, the magnetic field changes due to a change in I or due to the relative motion between the coil and conductor. The direction of the induced current is given by Fleming’s right-hand rule.

To know more about Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction, visit here.

Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule
According to Fleming’s right-hand rule, the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of the right hand are stretched to be perpendicular to each other, as indicated below. If the thumb indicates the direction of the movement of the conductor, the forefinger indicates the direction of the magnetic field, then the middle finger indicates the direction of the induced current.

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-15

Electric Generator
Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
Operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction.
AC Generation: The axle attached to the two rings is rotated so that the arms AB and CD move up and down, respectively, in the produced magnetic field. Thus, the induced current flows through ABCD.
CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-16

After half rotation, the direction of the current in both arms changes. Again by applying Fleming’s right-hand rule, the induced currents are established in these arms along directions DC and BA; therefore, the induced I flows through DCBA.
DC Generation: They work just like AC; they use half rings to produce current in one direction only without variations in magnitude.
To know more about Electric generators, visit here.

Domestic Electric Circuits
Fuse
A fuse is a protective device in an electrical circuit in times of overloading.
Overloading is caused when the neutral and live wires come in contact due to damage to the insulation or a fault in the line.
In times of overloading, the current in the circuit increases (short circuit) and becomes hazardous. Joule’s heating (resistive or ohmic heating on the passage of current) in the fuse device melts the circuit and breaks the flow of current in the circuit.
CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-17
 

CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-18
Domestic Electric Circuits
Livewire has a voltage of 220 V and is covered with red insulation.
Earth wire has a voltage of 0 V (the same as Earth) and is covered with green insulation.
The neutral wire has black insulation.
In our houses, we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz.
CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 13-19

Power Loss in Transmission
Power losses in transmission lines over long distances occur due to Joule’s heating. This heat (H) ∝ l2R causes losses, where R is the line resistance.

Joule’s Law of Heating
Joule’s law is a mathematical description of the rate at which resistance in a circuit converts electric energy into heat energy. The joule’s first law shows the relationship between heat produced by flowing electric current through a conductor and is given by the following formula:

\(\begin{array}{l}Q = I^{2}RT[\latex]
Where Q indicates the amount of heat, I is the electric current, R is the electric resistance in the circuit, and T is the time.
